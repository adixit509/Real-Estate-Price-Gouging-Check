# Real-Estate-Price-Gouging-Check
The aim of this project is to serve as an aid to real estate agents to check for price gouging by potential sellers. It uses a linear regression model which uses multiple parameters such as prices of properties around the area,
whether there has been construction on the property, and the presence local attractions/amenities in the area around the property. In the future additions of this project, we can further enchance the accuracy of this model, we can also 
add features such as a crawler which checks for fake photos uploaded by a seller, and it may also be able to provide an overview of the land's history which might also potentially affect the price of the land. This project uses the dataset and code from 
GeeksforGeeks(link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-linear-regression-with-scikit-learn/)kaggle(link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset), the information required to start this project by
